# CS7324: Machine Learning in Python
### Xingming Qu

All the code are provided as Jupyter notebook.


## Lab Assignment One: Exploring Table or Text Data 
You are to perform preprocessing and exploratory analysis of a data set: exploring the statistical summaries of the features, visualizing the attributes, and addressing data quality.


## Lab Assignment Two: Exploring Image Data 
You are to perform preprocessing and exploratory analysis of a data set: exploring the statistical summaries of the features, visualizing the attributes, and addressing data quality. 




## Lab Assignment Three: Extending Logistic Regression 
In this lab, you will compare the performance of logistic regression optimization programmed in scikit-learn and via your own implementation. You will also modify the optimization procedure for logistic regression. 



## Lab Assignment Four: Evaluation and Multi-Layer Perceptron 
In this lab, you will compare the performance of multi-layer perceptrons programmed in scikit-learn and via your own implementation. 



## Lab Assignment Five: Wide and Deep Network Architectures
In this lab, you will select a prediction task to perform on your dataset, evaluate two different deep learning architectures and tune hyper-parameters for each architecture. 

Investigate generalization performance by altering the number of layers in the deep branch of the network. Try at least two different number of layers. Use the method of cross validation and evaluation metric that you argued for at the beginning of the lab to select the number of layers that performs superiorly. 

## Lab Assignment Six: Convolutional Network Architectures
In this lab, you will select a prediction task to perform on your dataset, evaluate a deep learning architecture and tune hyper-parameters.

Investigate at least two different convolutional network architectures (and investigate changing some parameters of each architecture). Use the method of cross validation and evaluation metric that you argued for at the beginning of the lab. Visualize the performance of the training and validation sets per iteration (use the "history" parameter of Keras).

## Lab Assignment Seven: Recurrent Network Architectures
In this lab, you will select a prediction task to perform on your dataset, evaluate a recurrent architecture and tune hyper-parameters. 

Investigate at least two different recurrent network architectures (perhaps LSTM and GRU). Be sure to use an embedding layer (pre-trained, from scratch, or both). Adjust hyper-parameters of the networks as needed to improve generalization performance.
